Most of the time, women who have had abortions can go on to have healthy pregnancies . The risks from a medical abortion appears to be lower than that of a surgical abortion . A surgical abortion involves removing the fetus with suction and a tool called a curette . To avoid pregnancy soon after an abortion, use contraception . After an abortion, many doctors recommend waiting until the bleeding ends before having sex again . Some doctors advise waiting until at least one menstrual period has come and gone . In some cases, it is necessary to delay having sex for longer, especially if the abortion took place later in the pregnancy or if there were complications .",abortion,pregnancy,abortions,contraception,fertility

A 2019 review reports that following a plant-based (but not necessarily raw) diet has significant benefits for physical health and disease . A raw food diet tends to be high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes . Eating a range of these foods will provide plenty of vitamins, minerals, and healthful fats, and protein . Cooking destroys some nutrients, such as water-soluble vitamin B and vitamin C, so eating food raw ensures a better supply of these . Anecdotal evidence suggests that people on the raw food diet may experience clearer skin, more energy, sustained weight loss, and a reduction in cholesterol and lipid levels . The cooking process kills some toxins, bacteria, and harmful compounds in food . People following any plant-based diet must take care to get all the nutrients they need as some nutrients are more common in animal products .",dietary,diet,vegetarian,nutritional,vegan

Dermatologists may prescribe topical creams or ointments that contain potent corticosteroids . Light therapy, or phototherapy, can help restore color to areas of depigmentation . There is currently no cure for vitiligo and no way to prevent the condition . Depigmentation involves removing the pigment from healthy skin, giving the skin a more consistent color . To remove pigment, a person must apply depigmentation creams to pigmented areas once or twice a day .

By definition, malignant tumors are more aggressive than benign tumors . Benign brain tumors grow slowly and do not spread from the original growth site . Two-thirds of all new brain tumors are benign, according to the American Brain Tumor Association . The WHO reclassified all types of brain and spinal cord tumors in 2016 . Symptoms of brain tumors vary depending on the type of tumor and its location . Common symptoms include persistent headaches, problems with vision, nausea, vomiting, and general drowsiness . Up to half of people with a brain tumor experience a seizure at some point . Most people with brain tumors do not have a family history of the condition . The only known environmental risk factor for brain tumors is exposure to radiation . Surgery is not effective against tumors that are deep in the brain tissue or those that have spread across a wide area of brain tissue . Radiation cannot distinguish between tumorous cells and healthy cells . Different forms of radiation therapy can reduce damage to healthy tissue . Chemotherapy entails the use of specific drugs to treat brain tumors .",glioma,tumor,glioblastoma,gliomasa,cancer

Researchers modified the activity of as few as three genes to “ shield ” the new stem cells from the immune system, and allow the body to more easily accept them . This is the first time anyone has engineered cells that can be universally transplanted and can survive in immunocompetent recipients without eliciting an immune response .

One reason viruses from animals are so dangerous to humans is that people have no means to deal with them . Bats' unique immune capabilities enable them to carry and maintain a high viral load without getting sick themselves . Virus that adapts to humans might be less dangerous in the long term because the ‘evolutionary arms race’ between virus and host has reached a stalemate .

Both male and female cats respond to catnip in a way that is reminiscent of sexual arousal among these felines . About 30% of domestic cats have absolutely no reaction to the plant . The difference, says Ronald Siegel, lies in cat DNA . Cats can inherit a dominant gene that guides the reaction to cat nip, adds Siegel . Catnip is by far the best known cat stimulant, but there are other plants that can alter felines’ moods and behaviors . Matatabi, or silver vine, is a plant native to areas of Japan and China .

1952,articles/1952.txt,Antarctic Killer Whales migrate once a year to tropical waters to give birth to their young," Researchers from the National Marine Fisheries Service in La Jolla, CA, and the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University in Newport may now have the answer . They tracked 62 Antarctic killer whales (Orcinus orca) for approximately 7 years, between 2009 and 2016 . Of these, at least three whales made long-distance round trips of up to 11,000 kilometers (approximately 6,835 miles) that took them 6–8 weeks to complete . Antarctic killer whales often take on a yellowish discoloration . This is a result of the skin becoming covered in a film of diatoms, or microscopic algae, which suggests that they are not experiencing their normal, “self-cleaning ” skin molt . Researchers say that, though calving may also usually take place upon the whales’ arrival into tropical waters, this process may actually be coincidental .",whale,cetaceans,cetacean,antarctic,fisheries
